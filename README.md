# 🛠️ Decentralized Bounty Hunt
## 📜 Project Description
This project is a decentralized bounty hunt platform deployed on the Stacks Testnet, built using the Clarity smart contract language. The system enables users to post bounties (tasks) with STX token rewards, allows others to claim and complete these bounties, and automatically transfers rewards upon confirmation. All actions and transactions are executed transparently on the blockchain without intermediaries.
The smart contract manages the entire workflow: bounty creation, claiming, submission, completion confirmation, and reward distribution, ensuring security and transparency.

## 🔭 Project Vision
The vision of Decentralized Bounty Hunt is to demonstrate the potential of decentralized task marketplaces on the Stacks blockchain. By leveraging a trustless and transparent mechanism, we aim to:
* Showcase the power of Clarity smart contracts for real-world Web3 applications.
* Encourage developers and businesses to explore decentralized work models.
* Lay the foundation for a scalable Web3 bounty platform.

## ⭐ Key Features
  ✅ Create New Bounty: Users can post a bounty with a description and an STX reward.
  
  🔄 Claim Bounty: Others can claim a bounty to work on it.
  
  📝 Submit Bounty Result: Claimants submit their results (text-based) to the bounty creator.
  
  🧠 Confirm Completion: Bounty creators confirm completion, triggering automatic reward transfer.
  
  💸 Reward Management: STX is locked in the contract upon bounty creation and securely transferred upon completion.
  
  🔐 On-chain Logic: All bounty management, state tracking, and transactions are handled on-chain.
  
  🚫 Cancel Bounty: Bounty creators can cancel unclaimed bounties and reclaim their STX reward.

## 🚀 Future Scope
  🧩 User Interface Integration: Build a web interface (e.g., React + Stacks.js) for seamless user interaction.
  
  📊 Reputation System: Add a rating system for bounty hunters to enhance trust.
  
  🪙 sBTC Integration: Support payments with sBTC (Bitcoin pegged asset) on Stacks.
  
  ⚖️ Dispute Resolution: Implement a dispute mechanism for handling disagreements.
  
  👾 Bounty Categorization: Support bounty categories (e.g., coding, design, content creation).
  
  🧪 Testing & Auditing: Expand test coverage and conduct security audits for the contract.
  
  🌍 Web3 Bounty Platform: Scale into a comprehensive decentralized bounty hunting ecosystem.
